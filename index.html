            <p>Sample Menus: Healthy Eating for Older Adults. Planning a day’s worth of meals using smart food choices
                might
                seem
                overwhelming at first. Here are some sample menus to show you how easy it can be. These menus provide

                calories
                a day and do not exceed the recommended amount of sodium or calories from saturated fats and added

                <h1>BREAKFAST FOOD</h1>
                <p>This is a classic summer side dish. We don’t usually call for bags of vegetables that are already
                    cut,
                    but we make an exception for coleslaw because it’s tricky to cut c</p>

                <h1>PASTA ITALIYAN</h1>
                <p>Although this healthy pasta dish is pretty simple to begin with, it's made even easier because you

                    throw the green beans and pasta into one big pot to cook. —Laura Flowers, Moscow, Idaho</p>

                <P>I love to bake and cook, especially Italian dishes like this homemade ravioli recipe. In fact, my

                    a perfect day consists of cooking my family's favorite foods then watching them dig in!—Lori
